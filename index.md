Kebab Engine is a video game engine for 3D games. It has been developed as an assigment for the subject of Game Engines in the third year at CITM-UPC's university degree of design and development of videogames. The objective of the subject is to create a game engine from zero using OpenGL, this is the final result.

Hope you like it and it's useful for your projects.
